            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With a rich foundation in Information Technology from the Vellore Institute of Technology, my journey has led me to a pivotal role as a Software Developer at Ericsson, where I honed my expertise in big data technologies and Python. My core competencies lie in application development, solution design and product management, enhanced by a deep understanding of data engineering principles and the pursuit of a Master's degree at the prestigious Texas McCombs School of Business.
                At Ericsson, my team and I developed innovative solutions for network analytics and 5G operations, embedding multiple operators onto a singular platform in Malaysia. Our collaborative efforts in designing business intelligence tools significantly reduced network migration costs. Embracing leadership as the product SME at Ericsson Malaysia, I championed operational readiness, fostering a culture of efficiency and tech-forward solutions. I am driven to contribute to an organization that values pioneering technology and collaborative success.</p>
